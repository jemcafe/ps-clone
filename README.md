## PS Clone

A photoshop clone project (not including every feature) built with React, Redux and Sass. Not all options in the app are meant to function, some are placeholders. The cursors that aren't supplied by the browser, I made in Illustrator.

[Demo](https://jemcafe.github.io/ps-clone/)

### Installed

* redux
* react-redux
* node-sass-chokidar
* npm-run-all

### Fix

* In HueGradient, stop the color position from resetting when re-rendered after being collapsed.
